# [Curling]

Author: [Brandon Oh]

This project would be a **game playing curling with another player or a cpu**.
The rules might be modified a little. For example, how its going to be scored,
or whether the broom would be available or not but the bottom line rule would be 
based on the actual game of curling.

I would enjoy developing this project not only because I love the sport, 
but I think it would be a enjoyable game to anyone without knowing the rules. 
Curling is one of the games that are not too complicate to understand but could
have so many player strategies and possibilities created by the players. Moreover, 
there were not a lot of games involving curling available which make the development 
of the project more interesting.

The project would involve an external **physics library** called BOX2D that was included
in the cinder block as a default
The library allows physical bodies to have a fluid and natural movement based on a real world
movement

The Plan of the project was:
* Week 1
  * Initial plan: The ball launching and the basic set up 
  would be finished.
  * How it went: completed the initial and
  was able to finish a simple launcher using keys

* Week 2
  * Initial plan: the ball launching and the basic set up would be finished.
  * How it went: In addition to the initial plan also finished
  a scoring mechanism and different options to play the game
  
* Week 3
  * Initial plan: scores and extra features(broom sweeping)
                        and cpu strategy would be implemented.
  * How it went: Was not able to implement the broom sweeping but implemented
  a computer strategy for the user to go against



Extra features would include cpu strategy and the **ability to sweeping**
so that the velocity of the ball could be changed on the way to the target.
Moreover, other features such as better animations might be implemented, ~~but the sweeping would
be the priority for extra features.~~

Because the broom sweeping became unnecessary because it was disrupting the flow of the game,
a computer strategy was instead implemented for more fun of the user.
